This Cinema Room REST service allows moviegoers to purchase tickets for a specific seat. Each ticket has a unique id that can be used to keep track of them. This id can also be used to return a ticket. A movie theater manager can see how many tickets were sold, how many seats are available, and how much income was generated from the ticket sales.
